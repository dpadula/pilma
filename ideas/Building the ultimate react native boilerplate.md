Hey everyone!

I’m currently working on a React Native boilerplate that’s designed to make kickstarting your next app project a breeze with a custom homepage built with react.

Current Features:

✅ Custom Homepage

✅ Auth Pages (Supabase + Apple Auth)

✅ Profile Management

🎨 Easy theme customization

Tech Stack:

Expo

NativeWind/Tailwind

Iconify

Supabase

Upcoming:

Google Auth

Stripe Integration

Dark Mode

Push Notifications

Before I finalize it, I’d love to get some community feedback. Is there anything specific you’d like me to include? Maybe features you find essential in boilerplates or something you’ve always wished existed out of the box?

I am also available for help with any mobile/web related projects.
